# About the Wyoming Technology Coronavirus Coalition's Checklists
A list of [checklists] for any [WYTechCC] projects (code or otherwise) that help make sure nobody missed something.

[![github pages](https://github.com/wytechcc/ProjectChecklists/workflows/github%20pages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wytechcc/ProjectChecklists/actions?query=workflow%3A%22github+pages%22)

While this documentation provides information, it's more
focused towards internal volunteers. The main website is
intended for public voicing.

Why are these docs public? It's better to have one public
conversation (e.g. a slack thread or doc site) than
hundreds of PMs.
