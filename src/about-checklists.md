# About the Wyoming Technology Coronavirus Coalition's Checklists [![github pages](https://github.com/wytechcc/wytechcc.github.io/workflows/Github%20Pages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wytechcc/wytechcc.github.io/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Github+Pages%22)

[Documentation] for the WYTechCC volunteers to prevent duplication
& repeating ourselves.

This is no replacement for the main website, [wytechcc.com](https://wytechcc.com)

This is not a good place for todos, use Github Issues, Github Projects, Trello, or Google Sheets to manage & assign those.


Why are these docs public? It's better to have one public
conversation (e.g. a slack thread or doc site) than
hundreds of PMs.

> Protip. Hit the search bar to quickly find something.
