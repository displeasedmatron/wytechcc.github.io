# KanBan boards, todo list apps

KanBan boards are for handling many tasks and the herds of people to help you with them.

## Managing Tasks in KanBan Boards

* [ ] create tasks (on GitHub or Trello), add checklists, and be descriptive
* [ ] assign it to users (if there's a user) or move it to the "doing" column without assigning one
* [ ] move tasks along the board as they get completed
* [ ] consider a "backlog" board for ideas you don't want to do. This'll prevent people from saying "have you thought of XYZ"

## GitHub Projects tips
* [ ] enable automation in each column to move items originally created as issues through the boards automatically.
