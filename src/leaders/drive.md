# Google Drive

Google drive can help coordinate volunteers with collaborative documents. Select the scope below:

## Team-wide document folders
* create a directory for things you want to be public. ANYTHING in this directory gets shared with the group
* share with the email addresses you collected
## Individual documents
* consider making the links to resources public
* add email addresses you want to have permission to edit things
