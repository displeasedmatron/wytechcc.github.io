# Task Delegation

Consider the following delegation strategies:

* [ ] Spatial: Regional Directors (e.g., 3D printing, Sewing)
* [ ] Chronological(-Spatial): Event Coordinators (e.g., Medical Supply Drives)
* [ ] Subtopics (e.g., Code -> individual code projects)
* [ ] Repeated tasks (notify new users from the survey spreadsheet with a nice hello in slack? might be a bad example.)

  * [ ] Trello
  * [ ] GitHub
