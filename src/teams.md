# Point Persons
A list of contacts for any particular project

You can also find the project lead in the topic of any slack channel.

## How You Can Help
Ask the point person how they'd like to be contacted, and what details we can list
publicly on this site. **DO NOT** list our external contacts (e.g. from the spreadsheet)

Every project needs a leader - don't leave anything abandoned or disorganized.

## I Have An Idea
