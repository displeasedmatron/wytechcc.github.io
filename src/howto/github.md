# GitHub

> Training lead: Cameron Whiting

## Setting Up A Github Account

* [ ] Generate an SSH key (linux users) and add it to your profile.
  * [ ] you may also want to share the SSH key if you're going to be pushing changes to the servers (probably not)
* [ ] (optional) Generate a GPG key and add it to your profile

## Working locally with files
* [ ] use an IDE like [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [ ] use SSH to push changes (or use atom's github integrations), instead of HTTP passwords - clone with the ssh URL.
