* [ ] Documentation's [KanBan board](https://github.com/wytechcc/wytechcc.github.io/projects/1)

## Developing
* [ ] read the [README](https://github.com/wytechcc/wytechcc.github.io/blob/master/README.md) for information on running a local copy of these docs as you edit.
* [ ] if you have a spreadsheet, ask Cameron to use his .xlsx to markdown-table converter. save typing.
* [ ] [How to write markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Volunteering Documentation
* any pinned messages
* the channel leader (found in the channel topic) - if it's changed
* any links people have posted - I'll evaluate it and ask leadership whether it should be a link on the website, volunteer documentation, or only internally shared.
* spell check things. tell me if something's confusing.

## Topics to cover
If you're a channel leader or are interested in coordinating
documentation for a particular channel, reach out to Cameron
Whiting.

* Domain Specific Topics
  * `Sewing`
  * `3D Printing` - hospitals will select from the google sheets the parts they want printed.
* External Coordination Topics
  * `GIS`
  * `Medical Supply Drives`
* Large Ingestion Topics
  * `Ideas`
* Skills based topics
  * `designers`
  * `coders`
  * `engineers`
  * `teachers`
  * `social media` (see also, PR/Press)
* Announcement Topics
  * `community`
  * `announcements`
* News
  * `news-and-articles`
  * `news-wtcc-spotlighted` - if someone mentions something in an interview, do we have it documented?
  * `pr` / `press` channels

## What This is Not
* don't re-write the webpage, link to articles instead.
* don't re-write authoritative sources, link to them instead.

### Topics we don't duplicate
* Authoritative guidelines (see the above)
* `Jobs-hire-me` and `Jobs-Openings` slack channels
* `just-for-fun`, most of the `introductions` channels

## Quick and dirty regexes

* pasted links: `s/https([^ ]+)/* [https$1](https$1)/` - messy but okay
