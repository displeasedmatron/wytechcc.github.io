## De-Stressing
It's important to look back and remember that if you're:
1) trying to stay well informed  & 2) doing your part,
2) you're doing great things and we all appreciate you.

Try to remember that, like wearing a seatbelt, some parts
of this pandemic are preventative measures that can become
good habits :). Washing hands correctly helps with other
diseases, too, you know!

Other parts of this pandemic, such as staying at home, can
be stressful. If you're getting cabin fever, or need help
organizing your digital life when working from home, check
the website! There's beautiful pages under [help and resources](https://wytechcc.com/help-and-resources) to get you started!

The communities we forge (and re-discover) will hopefully
become stronger than ever after this.
