WytechCC knows of the following events:

* [Medical Supply Drives](https://wytechcc.com/events/)

We're working on an internal google calendar so that you
can stay up to date using your phone.

Our internal calendar for events we're organizing or cross-posting is here:
* [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YTU1MHMyNDR2OGd1Z292dGlpYWlhY2JpZDhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
* [ICal format](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/a550s244v8gugovtiiaiacbid8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

Add it to your calendar apps to keep up to date!

Team leaders & interested volunteers: get write access,
add events to the calendar if we missed something.

## External Events & Calendars:
The calendar is no substitute for external resources!
